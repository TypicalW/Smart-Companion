# Smart-Companion
An AI-powered smart companion integrating Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and a custom-trained model to perform basic interactive tasks. Designed for seamless human-like communication and everyday assistance.

## Motivation
We are a group of four college students building this as our mini-project, but our vision goes far beyond just fulfilling academic requirements. This project is a chance for us to explore cutting-edge technologies like Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and AI model integration skills that are highly relevant in todayâ€™s tech landscape.

What drives us is the desire to create something useful in real life, not just a proof-of-concept. We want our AI-powered smart companion to feel natural, intuitive, and genuinely helpful for everyday tasks. This project is as much about learning and experimenting as it is about delivering something functional, polished, and scalable.
